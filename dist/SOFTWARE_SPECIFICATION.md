## 10. Data Relationships

### Expense Entry Hierarchy
```
Expense Type (What kind) 
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Category (Specific item)
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Payment Method (How paid)
```

### Credit Card "Others" Logic
```
For each credit card in monthly report:
    Total Payment = Sum of credit_card_payments for that card
    Tracked Expenses = Sum of expenses paid with that card  
    Others = Total Payment - Tracked Expenses
    
    If Others > 0:
        Add "Card Name - Others" line to report
```

## 11. Security Considerations

- **File permissions**: Database file uses system default permissions

### Input Validation
- **SQL injection protection**: Parameterized queries throughout
- **XSS prevention**: Proper HTML escaping in frontend
- **Type validation**: Numeric amounts, date formats, required fields

## 12. Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
